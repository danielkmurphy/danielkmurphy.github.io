I am a socially driven individual who thrives in collaborative environments that continually plan, design and achieve targets. 

I qualified in 2015 with a Beng (Hons) in Sustainable Energy Engineering. I was awarded AIB Engineering Student of the Year 2015. On completion of my education, I was awarded a scholarship to attend the Green Building Solutions Program in the University of Vienna. 

Upon return, I commenced a role with the same company I had previously worked for as a Junior Project Manager, returning as a Project Manager. My first responsibility was to upgrade the energy efficiency of social and private housing, run by one of Ireland’s largest energy providers.  With a budget of €550,000 and a three month time-frame, I delivered the project one week early and within budget.

During the evenings, I attended night courses to upskill in Revit and Level 2 BIM.

In 2016, I set off to travel but spent a lot of my time self-learning about the construction industry in New Zealand. I sought out a labouring opportunity with a local builder to invest in my hands-on skills and on-site observations. I felt this to be critically important after working as a Project Manager previously but not having the practical knowledge I felt the role required. I wanted to be able to empathise with the work that the people I was managing were directed to do. Subsequently, I was offered a building apprenticeship. 

Throughout this 3 and a half year apprenticeship, I was awarded New Zealand Placemakers Apprentice of the Year in 2018 after working on some significantly detailed, high-end projects. I also kept an extensive work diary during this time, which my training assessor said was the most comprehensive and impressive workbook he’d ever seen.

I have now qualified and I intend to use these valuable on-site practices and observations for successful environmental consultant/management work in the future. 

In my spare time, I focus towards learning about the global energy crisis and I apply my knowledge and passion in the local community by upcycling wood offcuts destined for the skip, and creating projects with local artists and friends. 

During 2017/2018, I designed, planned and built my family’s own low impact Tiny House on Wheels. I built this house with an abundance of recycled material and within a very tight budget. This home demonstrates low impact living in terms of energy efficiency but also water sustainability. 

I would like to share my endless energy and passion for sustainability with people, collaborating in a supportive team environment. This is where I know I will thrive.
