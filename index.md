## Professional

I am a qualified sustainability engineer (BEng (Hons) in Sustainable Energy Engineering) and qualified builder/carpenter with a particular interest and passion in [Passive Housing (Passivhaus)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house) and the efficiency of heating systems and air quality. I am a socially driven individual who thrives in collaborative environments that continually plan, design and achieve targets. 

Since October 2016 I have been employed by [Level Construction](https://levelconstruction.co.nz/) in New Zealand.
